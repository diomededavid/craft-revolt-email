            </h3>
            <p>Keep people involved by following up with a personal message or discount code. Start by replacing the
                full-width header with a different color or a high-res image.</p>

            <p>If you sell things, welcome new customers after a purchase, let lapsed customers know you miss them, or
                offer a deal to your best customers. If you've connected your store, try adding product or product
                recommendation blocks, too.</p>

            <p>If you don't sell things, welcome new subscribers to your list, thank people for attending an event, and
                let inactive subscribers know you miss them.</p>
